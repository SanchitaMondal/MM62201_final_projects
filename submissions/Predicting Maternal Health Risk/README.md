# Predicting Material Risk: Analysis and Modeling

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset to predict material risk levels (e.g., low, mid, high) using various machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, hyper parameter optimization, and evaluation of multiple classification models.

## Files
- **`prediciting_material_risk.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning model implementation.
- **`README.md`**: Overview of the project.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies required to run the notebook.
- **`Report.pdf`**: PDF file containing the results and analysis.

## Running the code
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install Python 3.8+ if not already installed.
3. Create a venv
4. Install the requirements in the venv
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. launch jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
6. Open the file `prediciting_material_risk.ipynb`
7. Run all the cells
